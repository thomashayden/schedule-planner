TThe idea of the scraper code is to simply request data from the NEU databases and compile it into an easily accessable database of classes. This info file is used to outline the methods of accessing data from the NEU databases, which don't have an actual API

Ihe search page for NEU classes. What an average user uses.
https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/NEUCLSS.p_class_select

When the form is submitted, it directs to this page, with added post data.
https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/NEUCLSS.p_class_search

Full set of POST data the form sends when only narrowing the search by subject (in this case CS):
sel_day:dummy
STU_TERM_IN:201830
sel_subj:dummy
sel_attr:dummy
sel_schd:dummy
sel_camp:dummy
sel_insm:dummy
sel_ptrm:dummy
sel_levl:dummy
sel_instr:dummy
sel_seat:dummy
p_msg_code:You must select a term.
sel_crn:
sel_subj:CS
sel_crse:
sel_title:
sel_attr:%
sel_levl:%
sel_schd:%
sel_insm:%
sel_from_cred:
sel_to_cred:
sel_camp:%
sel_ptrm:%
sel_instr:%
begin_hh:0
begin_mi:0
begin_ap:a
end_hh:0
end_mi:0
end_ap:a

This is the mess of GET data that has the same of effect as the POST data (I don't know web that well and don't know why this works...)
